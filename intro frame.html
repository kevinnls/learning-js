        <b>How to Play:</b>
        <p>guess letters till you find the word in question.<br>
            &emsp; can you find the answer and escape the gallows?</p>
        <p>for each letter that isn't in the word,<br>
            &emsp; another part of you is hung.</p>
        <p>you may guess multiple letters at a time,<br>
            &emsp; but how sure are you of the answer...?</p>
        <p>remember. your life dangles on the string.</p>
